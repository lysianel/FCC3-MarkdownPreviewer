export const PLACEHOLDER =  `# Markdown Previewer

## Hello and Welcome!

This simple previewer allows you to render your markdown code as you type it in this editor.
You can type in \`inline code\` or even
\`\`\` 
let code = "some blockcode"
\`\`\`
You can also style your text as you need
- **in bold** 
- *in italic* 
- or any other style

> And even use blockquotes.

This is only an insight of what you can do. Check more on [github](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Built with React ![React Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lysianel/FCC3-MarkdownPreviewer/master/public/reactLogo.png). More info on [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/)`  ;
